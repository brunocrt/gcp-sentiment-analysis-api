# Sentiment Analysis using GooglesÂ´s (GCP) Natural Language Processing service.

This is a PoC for testing GCP NLP for analyse the sentiment of a text. This is a Java application API with built-in frontend page
for consuming an API that access the GCP NLP service.

# Requirements
In order to test it you do need to have:

- Google account with Language Service API enabled
- Java 1.8 or higher
- Maven 3.6.3

## Before you start
You need to create the service-account.json file generated by your GCP account and download it on the root folder of this project. This application will try to read this file using an environment variable set before its start. This file contains your secret credentials to
access the GCP langauge service. 
For more information acccess this page: https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/quickstart-client-libraries

# Development
Simple run the script command (windows)
`dev.cmd`

It will compile the project and start the Quarkus framework in development mode and then you can
open your web brower on the following port;

`http://localhost:8080/`

You can also check the API only using the Swagger UI page

`http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/`


# Usage
After opening the web brower on the main page (index.html) you will can type some
text and press the button to get the sentiment analysis in the following format:

`Result: {"language":"en","magnitude":"0.0","score":"0.0"}`

This is returned by the service that tells beyond the language of the text, its emotional strenght (magnitude) and 
its sentiment score (score); It is positive when score is greater than zero (0.0) or negative for lower values.
